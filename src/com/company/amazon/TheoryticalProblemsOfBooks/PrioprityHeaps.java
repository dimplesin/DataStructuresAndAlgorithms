        Give an algorithm to find all elements less than some value of k in a binary heap.

        Answer : Start from the root of the heap. If the value of the root is smaller than k then print its value and call recursivley
        once for its left child and once for its right child. If the value of a node is greater or equal than k then
        the function stops without printing that value. Complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in the heap.
        This bound takes place in the worst case, where the value of every node in the heap will be smaller than k, so the function has to call
        each node of the heap.
