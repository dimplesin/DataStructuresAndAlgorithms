   /* The probability generating function sum(pix^i) of the even distribution {1,2,...,12} is 1/12(x+x^2+...+x^12)=G(x)H(x) where G(x)=1/6(x+x^2+...+x^6), where G(x) is the probability generating function of the regular fair dice.

    Solving for H(x), you get H(x)=1/2*(x^0+x^6)=1/6(3x^0+3x^6) so the unmarked dice has 3 0's and 3 6's.

    distribution would look like this:
